- I created a react application without using bootstrap and jquery or any other external libraries
- There are three main components:
- Card.js, OrderSummary.js and PaymentForm.js
- Styles are written in app.css and made it responsive using media query and followed flex container approach
- Since it is symentic , it should be accessible
  ### Funtionality:
  - By default first card is selected and On click of each card, the data is populated in order summary and selected card background changes to black
